    shortDescription: Example project demonstrating how to use the jEAP Process Context Service.
    longDescription: >
      The Process Context Service addresses the challenge of providing process context for
      cross-service processes in an event-driven architecture without relying on a central
      process engine to control execution (favoring choreography over orchestration).
      It enables tracking and analyzing process progress and triggering events when specific
      state changes occur (e.g., completion of certain tasks). Delivered as a
      jEAP library, it is instantiated per business application by development teams, with
      application-specific process definitions in json files configured within it.
      This repository provides an example of how to use the Process Context Service.
      It contains the following modules:
      * jme-process-context-scs: An instance of the Process Context Service
      * jme-process-context-auth-scs: An instance of the OAuth mock server to access the Process Context Service
      * jme-process-context-app-service: A mock application using the Process Context Service.
        This app generates messages and calls the REST endpoints of the Process Context Service
        to simulate a real application.
    features:
      - Demonstrates instantiation and configuration of the Process Context Service and its features
      - Includes OAuth mock server for authentication
      - Provides a mock application simulating real-world usage
